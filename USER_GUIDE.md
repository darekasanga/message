## Technical Information

### Privacy & Security

### How It Works
The app creates a PNG image of your message card with your chosen design. This image is then shared using Android's standard sharing mechanism (Intent), which means it works with any app that accepts images.

## Troubleshooting

### LINE doesn't open when I tap "Send to LINE"
- Make sure LINE is installed on your device
- If LINE is not installed, the app will show you other sharing options

### The preview doesn't show my message
- Make sure you've entered text in the message field
- Tap the "Preview Card" button to update the preview

### The colors look different in the preview
- The preview shows a simplified version
- The actual card will have the full color scheme you selected

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Keep messages concise** - Shorter messages are easier to read and look better on the card
2. **Use proper capitalization** - It makes your message more professional
3. **Preview before sending** - Always check the preview to ensure your message looks good
4. **Choose colors wisely** - Pick colors that match the mood of your message
